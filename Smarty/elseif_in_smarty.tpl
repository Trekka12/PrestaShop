<!-- For those of you who, like me, dabble with multiple coding languages daily, it's easy to confuse the various syntaxes
To use else if in Smarty one writes like so:
-->

{if $something}
{elseif $something == 2}
{/if}

<!-- It's written together, not as in JavaScript where its written separated the "else" and the "if" -->
<!-- I personally also write it separate in PHP, but have noted in PHP.net manual lately that apparently together works just as well :) -->
